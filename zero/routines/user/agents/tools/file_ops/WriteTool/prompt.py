DESCRIPTION = (
            'Writes a file to the local filesystem. '
            'This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path. '
            'If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file\'s contents -- '
            'this tool will fail if you did not read the file first. '
            'Prefer the Edit tool for modifying existing files -- it only sends the diff. '
            'Only use this tool to create new files or for complete rewrites. '
            'NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested.'
